        <h1>Fractured Time - Level Design</h1>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/menu2.PNG"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">Fractured time is a level design project that I decided to create to both improve my skills in level design</p>
        <p>and to learn how to use Unreal Engine as this is the first project that I have done in UE5.</p>
        <p>The main idea of the level is that the player movement is simplistic with double jump, sprint and crouch fucntions. </p>
        <p>The level itself features different themed areas from history converging into a single point.</p>
        <p class="NextParagraph">all visual assets were from asset packs on the Unreal Engine store and none of them are my own personal work.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/LevelSketch1.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/LevelSketch2.png"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">Above are the initial sketches that were drawn up for the level which a lot of the layout and ideas were</p>
        <p>kept throughout the development of the level. Luckily when starting the project, I already had </p>
        <p>different asset packs on Unreal which helped with creating visual aspect of the level.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/First Section.gif"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">The first flythrough of the introduction to the level includes the spawn, first encounter and</p>
        <p>entrance to the next section of the level being the castle.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/Castle.gif"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">The next section is the castle themed area which includes an open village district where the player</p>
        <p>use the houses as cover and find different pickups to aid them in the encounter. After this,</p>
        <p>the player will encounter the convergence room. The player will need to choose</p>
        <p>whether to go through the Olympus path or the Viking path.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/Olympus.gif"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">The Olympus path includes two encounters, one being in a small room, and the other being</p>
        <p>found within a circular arena. Once the player finishes both encounters, there is a healing room</p>
        <p>for them to replenish health before the next area.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/Viking.gif"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">The Viking path also includes two encounters which vary is size and shape. The first encounter</p>
        <p>is a longer path while the second encounter is a donut shaped room as the centre</p>
        <p>is a large rock structure. There is also a healing room after both encounters.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/Throne.gif"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">After the player finishes the side that they chose, they will find themselves in a new encounter</p>
        <p>which acts as the convergence room to bring both paths back into one.</p>
        <p>Once this encounter is completed, then the player will enter the final room</p>
        <p>before they finish the level.</p>

        <p class="NextParagraph">After creating the first design of the level in Unreal Engine, the main focus was</p>
        <p>to revamp the encounters as they were very basic and didn't allow</p>
        <p>for the player controller to utilize the movement options.</p>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/FirstEncounter1.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/FirstEncounterRevamp.png"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">The top image is the original layout of the first encounter and the bottom image</p>
        <p>is the first encounter that has been remade to incorporate the movement</p>
        <p>options. The encounter also has pickups and enemies placed.</p>
        <p class="NextParagraph">Every encounter was remade and had pickups and enemies place within them.</p>
        <h3 class="NextParagraph">Olympus Encounter</h3>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/OlympusEncounter.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/OlympusEncounterRemade.png"></a>
        <h3 class="NextParagraph">Viking Encounter</h3>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/VikingEncounter.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/VikingEncounterRemade.png"></a>
        <h3 class="NextParagraph">Convergence Encounter</h3>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/ConvergenceEncounter.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/ConvergenceEncounterRemade.png"></a>
        <h3 class="NextParagraph">Throne Encounter</h3>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/ThroneEncounter.png"></a>
        <a><img class="FracturedTimeGif" src="./Images/ThroneEncounterRemade.png"></a>
        <p class="NextParagraph">Overall, I have been able to expand my knowledge especially in the field of Unreal Engine</p>
        <p>and level design as this was the first time using Unreal Engine and creating a level</p>
        <p>for a first person shooter genre of game. While I am proud of what I have created,</p>
        <p>I know for certain that there is still a lot for me to learn so this project</p>
        <p>was a great inital step in terms of level design and using Unreal Engine.</p>
