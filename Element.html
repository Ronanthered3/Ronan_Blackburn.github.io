        <p class="NextParagraph">Elemental Mastery is a third person shooter where the combination of different elements is key to progressing through the world.</p>
        <p>Elemental Mastery is set in an ancient world where the elements are the prime rulers. The player will be able to harness these elements to complete puzzles,</p>
        <p>defeat enemies and find objects to aid them throughout the game. The player has access to five different elements which include Earth, Fire, Water, Ice and Lightning.</p>
        <p>With the elements at hand, the player will be able to upgrade their elemental abilities further through the exploration of the world and the many secrets it holds.</p>
        <p class="NextParagraph">Currently, each element has four different abilities which consist of a left click/ primary fire, and three others</p>
        <p>ranging from damaging abilities, utility, movement or healing.</p>
